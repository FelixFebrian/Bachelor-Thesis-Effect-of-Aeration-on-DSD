\chapter*{Abstract}

The definition of a bioreactor sums up an artificially constructed space where biological reactions are carried out. Hence it should constitute the original ecosystem which provides an ideal environment for the partaking organisms, generally microscopic ones, as thoroughly and sufficiently as possible. This raises several issues regarding life sustainability of the microorganisms in the designed space, for instance mixing efficiency and nutrients supply.
