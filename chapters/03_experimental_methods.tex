\section{Objectve}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Comparison of droplet size in aerated and non-aerated stirred tank
  \item See how the reaction of the system -- how the system affects bubble size
\end{enumerate}

\section{Parameters of the experiments}
The experiments in this work are Based on the theoretical fundamnet described in Chapter \ref{ch:state_of_the_art}. This work by itself continues some previous investigations on particle stress by Robert Panckow \todo{reference?}.
