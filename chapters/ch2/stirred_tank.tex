\section{Stirred Tank Bioreactor Design}

A bioreactor is generally described as a technicel equipment for growing organisms, typically bacteria or yeast, so that its metabolites products or its ability to convert organic waste can be benefitted from. The main objectives of bioreactor design can thus derived from this broad description, namely attaining the most ideal conditions for the organism's life sustainability yet maintaining the efficiency of its production yield. Clearly, each bioreactor has to be adapted to its underlying bioligical system. To achieve these objectives, a bioreactor design process has to address multiple issues, such as the mass and heat transfer, mixing efficiency, scale-up procedure, rheology, and many more. A comprehensive explanation bioreactor design criteria can be found in \citet{Mandenius2016}

At present, a number of design alternatives has emerged to answer these design issues. Some examples include the bubble column reactor, the airlift bioreactor and the wave bioreactor, each design having its own advantages and disadvantages. However, the predominantly used design for submerged culture, with a few exceptions, is the stirred tank bioreactor, which is also the main subject of this work. In spite of its drawback in form of mechanical agitation, the stirred tank is widely chosen due to its versatility, operability and manufacturability. Scale-up processes of a stirred tank has been extensively reviewed as well.

The design of a technical stirring device can be taken from e.g. DIN 28130. Figure \ref{fig:stirredTankLamTurb} depicts its main characteristic quantities.
