\section{Mechanism of Fluid Particles Breakup}

\subsection{Breakup due to turbulent fluctuation and collision}
\subsection{Breakup due to the viscous shear forces}
\textsc{Liao and Lucas}: Viscous shear forces in the continuous phase will cause a velocity gradient around the interface and deform the fluid particle. ... The particle is firstly elongated into two lumps separated by a thread and breaks into two almost equal size daughters corresponding to the lumps and a series of smaller particles called satellites corresponding to the thread.
